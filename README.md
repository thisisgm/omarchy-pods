## What it shows

- **Battery** for the left pod, the right pod and the case, each with a charging
  and in-ear hint. Nothing else on a Linux box knows these numbers: BlueZ does
  not expose `org.bluez.Battery1` for AirPods.
- **Listening mode**, and only the modes the device actually has. AirPods 1, 2, 3
  and the plain AirPods 4 get no section at all, AirPods Pro 3 dropped Off, and
  Adaptive needs an H2 part that also has noise cancellation, so the panel asks
  the daemon rather than assuming four rows.
- **Adaptive noise level**, shown only while Adaptive is the active mode.
- **Conversation Awareness** on the same models that have Adaptive, and
  **One-Bud ANC** on the ones with a second bud, which is why an AirPods Max 2
  shows the first and not the second.
- **Ear detection**: pause when one pod is out, pause when both are out, or
  never pause.
- **Case lid**, when the case has broadcast its state. Lid state comes from BLE
  advertisements, and the daemon pauses that discovery while the control link is
  up, because discovery running alongside a live link is what the crackle in issue
  26 tracks. So lid state holds its last value for as long as the pods stay
  connected, and the case level may keep refreshing over the control link, as it
  does here, or hold like the lid, as the issue 26 reporter saw. Per-pod battery, ANC and ear detection keep updating
  throughout.
- **A mark that matches the hardware**: stemmed buds, AirPods Pro or AirPods Max,
  chosen from the model the daemon reports. AirPods Max carry no case, so their
  panel drops the case row and shows a single headphone battery.

## Deliberately absent

- **Volume and output device** live in the stock Audio panel, which already
  switches PipeWire sinks. Press `Tab` in this panel to walk to it.
- **Connect, disconnect and forget** live in the stock Bluetooth panel, and in
  `omarchy bluetooth device`.
- **Spatial Audio** has no renderer on Linux, so there is nothing to draw and
  no row for it.
- **Mic mode** is not an AirPods control. macOS applies Voice Isolation to the
  input stream itself, for any microphone, and the AAP protocol carries no mic
  packet. Input mute and input device live in the stock Audio panel.

## Screenshots

The panel is built from the capability keys the daemon publishes, so three
different AirPods give three different panels. Same plugin, same build, nothing
configured differently between them.

Both AirPods 4 variants say **AirPods 4** in the title, because the name is the
family and the rows underneath are what the unit can actually do. The plain
AirPods 4 has no listening modes at all, so it gets no listening section.

Every screenshot in this section, the Pro 3 included, was made by writing one
status line by hand and photographing the panel that came back. An AirPods Pro 3
is the only pair on hand here, and it would not have posed for all of these
anyway. It works because the panel reads that file and nothing else.

## Requirements

- **The daemon in [`daemon/`](daemon/), built and running.** It ships in this
  repository because nothing packaged will do: upstream librepods and every AUR
  package built from it carry no state file, no `status` verb, none of the
  `ca:`, `onebud:` or `adaptive:` verbs, and a model map that stops before
  AirPods Pro 3, so the panel would stay hidden forever. The copy here carries
  every model number Apple lists as of August 2026, up to the 2026 AirPods
  Max 2, and what each of those models can actually do. See [daemon/UPSTREAM.md](daemon/UPSTREAM.md)
  for what it is, who wrote it and what was changed. `omarchy plugin add` only
  clones the plugin; `setup` builds the daemon.
- AirPods paired to the machine through the usual Bluetooth flow.

## How it works

The plugin does not poll. The daemon writes its status to
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/librepods/status.json` whenever that status changes, and
removes the file when it stops. The panel watches it, so an idle desktop runs no
processes at all on its behalf. `librepods-ctl` is used only when you actually
change something.

The plugin never talks to Bluetooth itself. If `librepods-ctl` is missing or
the daemon is not running, the panel says so in one line instead of drawing an
empty surface.

### The output codec, and what the microphone costs

The daemon always selects the highest-bitrate playback profile the card offers,
which is SBC-XQ at 453 kbps ahead of SBC at 328 and AAC at 256. That is the
default, and it is re-applied every time the daemon activates the card, because
PipeWire's own profile priority puts AAC first and would otherwise win.

Bitrate is not the whole story, and on AirPods it can be the wrong story. AAC is what the
hardware decodes natively and what macOS sends, and SBC-XQ at a higher bitrate is not
automatically the better of the two. If SBC-XQ sounds thin to you, name the codec you want
under `[audio]` in `~/.config/AirPodsTrayApp/AirPodsTrayApp.conf`:

```ini
[audio]
preferredCodec=AAC
```

Any codec the card lists as a playback profile, matched case-insensitively, so `AAC`,
`SBC-XQ` or `SBC` here. Restart the daemon to apply it. The named codec wins on every
connect, cold ones included. Leave it unset, or name one the card does not offer, and the
bitrate ranking above stands; an unmet preference is logged with the codec that could not
be honoured. A profile that is already active is still left alone, so changing the codec by
hand with `pactl set-card-profile` keeps working.

Selecting the AirPods as a **microphone** gives that up. Over the standard
Bluetooth profiles, two-way voice runs on a separate low-bandwidth channel, so
the only profiles exposing a source are `headset-head-unit` at 16 kHz mSBC and
`headset-head-unit-cvsd` at 8 kHz, and each one replaces the playback profile
rather than joining it. A card cannot offer a high-quality sink and a microphone
at the same time. macOS is bound by the same profiles and simply negotiates a
better voice codec on them.

So take the microphone from another device and leave the AirPods on SBC-XQ. The
daemon helps here: it defers its activation ladder while a capture is live, so it
will not pull a live call off the headset profile mid-sentence.

If the headset profiles are missing from the card altogether, so that nothing can
offer the AirPods microphone at all, BlueZ has no HFP connection to the device.
The card carries those two profiles only while that connection is up, which is
why nothing logs an error: no profile is malformed, one is simply not connected.
Reconnecting that one profile brings them back within a few seconds and leaves
A2DP playing:

```bash
busctl call org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0/dev_<MAC> org.bluez.Device1 \
  ConnectProfile s 0000111e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
```

Disconnecting and reconnecting the whole device also works, at the cost of the
playback link. This daemon registers no Bluetooth profile, so that list is
BlueZ's and PipeWire's to produce.

There is a route around all of this that uses no audio profile at all: the AirPods
can send a high-resolution microphone stream over the same AACP channel this
daemon already uses for battery and controls, which leaves A2DP playback running
untouched. Upstream librepods has an implementation of it for its Rust rewrite in
[PR 655](https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods/pull/655), unmerged at the time
of writing. Nothing in this daemon does that today.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/thisisgm/omarchy-pods --enable
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.thisisgm.omapods/setup
```

`--enable` already places the widget on the right of the bar. The
[marketplace listing](https://omarchyplugins.com/plugin.html?id=io.github.thisisgm.omapods)
installs to the same place.

`setup` installs `cmake`, `ninja`, `qt6-connectivity`, `qt6-tools`,
`qt6-declarative`, `pkgconf` and `libpulse` if they are missing, builds the
daemon into `~/.local`, and enables `librepods.service`. The icon stays hidden
until AirPods are connected (`hideWhenDisconnected`). To keep it visible:

```bash
omarchy bar set io.github.thisisgm.omapods hideWhenDisconnected false --json
```

To build the daemon by hand instead of running `setup`:

```bash
omarchy pkg add cmake ninja qt6-connectivity qt6-tools qt6-declarative pkgconf libpulse
cd ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.thisisgm.omapods/daemon
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF && cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable librepods.service
systemctl --user restart librepods.service
```

`~/.local` is the prefix the unit expects, because it runs
`%h/.local/bin/librepods`, and Omarchy already puts `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`,
which is where the panel finds `librepods-ctl`. The unit is bound to
`graphical-session.target`, so the daemon comes back after a reboot.

## Remove

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now librepods.service
xargs rm -f < ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.thisisgm.omapods/daemon/build/install_manifest.txt
rm -rf ~/.config/AirPodsTrayApp ~/.local/state/librepods
omarchy plugin remove io.github.thisisgm.omapods
```

The daemon installs into `~/.local`, so it outlives the plugin. CMake lists what it
put there in `install_manifest.txt`, which lives in the build tree, so that line has
to run before the plugin directory goes.

`~/.config/AirPodsTrayApp` holds the paired device's name and its `magicAccIRK` and
`magicAccEncKey`, which are pairing secrets, so the directory and the file are created
owner only and both go with the plugin. `~/.local/state/librepods/status.json` is the
published status line the panel reads, and it goes too.

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k`, `↓` / `↑` | move between rows |
| `enter` / `space` | activate the current row |
| `←` / `→` | adjust the adaptive noise level |
| `o` | Off, on the models that have it |
| `t` | Transparency |
| `a` | Adaptive |
| `n` | Noise Cancellation |
| `c` | toggle Conversation Awareness |
| `b` | toggle One-Bud ANC |
| `e` | cycle ear detection |
| `r` | refresh |
| `tab` | move to the next panel |
| `esc` | close |

Every listening key is ignored on a device the daemon says lacks the mode, so
`a` does nothing on an AirPods Pro 1 and the four mode keys do nothing on an
AirPods 3. A daemon older than the capability keys cannot say, and the panel
falls back to what it gated on before.

Left click opens the panel. Right click cycles the listening mode without
opening anything.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Hide when disconnected | on | Leaves the bar entirely rather than sitting there with nothing to say. |
| Path to librepods-ctl | empty | Leave empty to find it on `PATH`. |

## Tests

`Model.js` holds the parsing and formatting, with no QML imports, so it runs
outside the shell. The suite covers the shapes that bite: the objects the daemon
omits entirely, a pod it has stopped hearing from, an empty file, a line that is
not JSON, and a schema newer than this panel reads.

```bash
deno run --allow-read tests/model.test.js
```

## Credits

The hard part is not this panel. It is
[librepods](https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods) by **Kavish Devar**, which
reverse-engineered Apple's AAP protocol over L2CAP and the BLE advertisement
path that carries battery, in-ear and case lid state. The daemon in `daemon/` is
a modified copy of his work, and this panel is a display for it.

## Licence

Two programs live here, and they are licensed separately because they are
separate works that talk over a state file and a command line.

| Path | Licence | |
|---|---|---|
| repository root, the bar widget | MIT | [LICENSE](LICENSE) |
| `daemon/`, a modified copy of librepods | GPL-3.0 | [daemon/LICENSE](daemon/LICENSE) |

Shipping both in one repository is aggregation, not combination, so the widget
stays MIT and the daemon stays GPL-3.0. What was modified, and the upstream
commit it was forked from, are recorded in
[daemon/UPSTREAM.md](daemon/UPSTREAM.md).

The three product outlines in `AirPodsIcon.qml` are Apple's, taken from the
chapter navigation on [apple.com/airpods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) so the
bar shows the hardware you actually own. AirPods, AirPods Pro and AirPods Max are
trademarks of Apple Inc., which does not sponsor or endorse this plugin. Those
outlines are not this project's to license, so the MIT grant above does not reach
them and nothing here gives you permission to reuse them.
